              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Words cannot fully express the gratitude that fills my heart when I think of you. 
                You are so much more than an aunt to me - you are my role model, my inspiration, 
                and one of the most important people in my life.
              </p>

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Thank you for being my provider in ways both big and small. Even when you had 
                very little, you always found a way to give. Your generosity has taught me that 
                true wealth isn't measured in money, but in the love we share and the lives we touch.
              </p>

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Thank you for being someone I can look up to. Your strength, wisdom, and character 
                have shown me what it means to be a good person. Every decision I make, I think 
                about the values you've instilled in me.
              </p>

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Thank you for respecting me and teaching me to respect others. You've shown me 
                that respect is earned through consistency, kindness, and staying true to your word. 
                Your example has shaped how I treat everyone I meet.
              </p>

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Thank you for being you - authentic, caring, strong, and loving. You make our 
                family better, our gatherings brighter, and our lives infinitely richer.
              </p>

              <p className="leading-relaxed font-medium text-pink-600">
                I respect you so, so much, Aunt Abeni. More than you'll ever know.
